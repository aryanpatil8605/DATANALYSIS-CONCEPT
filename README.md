## **Section 1: Mathematics Concepts**

### 1. Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Variance

#### Mean
- **Definition**: The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the count of numbers.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum{x_i}}{n}
  \]
  where \(x_i\) is each value and \(n\) is the number of values.

**Example**:  
For the data set [5, 10, 15]:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{5 + 10 + 15}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10
\]

#### Median
- **Definition**: The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
  
**Example**:
- For [3, 1, 2]:  
  Sorted: [1, 2, 3] → Median = 2
- For [1, 2, 3, 4]:  
  Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Median = \(\frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5\)

#### Mode
- **Definition**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A data set may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.

**Example**:  
For [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]:  
- Mode = 2 (appears most frequently)  
For [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]:  
- Modes = 1 and 2 (bimodal)  

#### Variance
- **Definition**: Variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Variance} = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \text{Mean})^2}}{n}
  \]

**Example**:  
For the data set [5, 10, 15]:
1. Mean = 10
2. Variance = \(\frac{(5-10)^2 + (10-10)^2 + (15-10)^2}{3} = \frac{25 + 0 + 25}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67\)

#### Standard Deviation
- **Definition**: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the spread of data points.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}}
  \]

**Example**:  
For the previous variance example:
\[
\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{16.67} \approx 4.08
\]

### R and Python Code
**R Code**:
```r
data <- c(5, 10, 15)
mean_value <- mean(data)
median_value <- median(data)
mode_value <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(data), decreasing=TRUE)[1]))  # Simple mode calculation
variance_value <- var(data)
sd_value <- sd(data)

cat("Mean:", mean_value, "\nMedian:", median_value, "\nMode:", mode_value, "\nVariance:", variance_value, "\nSD:", sd_value)
```

**Python Code**:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

data = [5, 10, 15]
mean_value = np.mean(data)
median_value = np.median(data)
mode_value = stats.mode(data)[0][0]
variance_value = np.var(data)
sd_value = np.std(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean_value}, Median: {median_value}, Mode: {mode_value}, Variance: {variance_value}, SD: {sd_value}")
```

### 2. Hypothesis Testing (p-value, t-test)

#### Hypothesis Testing
- **Definition**: A statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.

#### Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))
- **Definition**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference. It is the hypothesis that the researcher tries to disprove.

#### Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\))
- **Definition**: The hypothesis that states there is an effect or a difference.

#### p-value
- **Definition**: The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- **Interpretation**:
  - A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.
  - A high p-value (> 0.05) suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject it.

#### t-test
- **Definition**: A t-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

**Types of t-tests**:
1. **Independent t-test**: Compares means between two unrelated groups.
2. **Paired t-test**: Compares means from the same group at different times.
3. **One-sample t-test**: Tests the mean of a single group against a known mean.

**Example**:
1. **Independent t-test**:
   - Suppose you want to compare the test scores of two different classes.  
   Group A: [85, 90, 92]  
   Group B: [78, 82, 80]  
   Perform a t-test to see if the means are significantly different.

**R Code**:
```r
groupA <- c(85, 90, 92)
groupB <- c(78, 82, 80)
t_test_result <- t.test(groupA, groupB)
print(t_test_result)
```

**Python Code**:
```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

groupA = [85, 90, 92]
groupB = [78, 82, 80]
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(groupA, groupB)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, p-value: {p_value}")
```

### 3. Probability Distribution

#### Probability Distribution
- **Definition**: A probability distribution describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable. 

**Types**:
1. **Discrete Probability Distribution**: Deals with discrete outcomes (e.g., rolling a die).
2. **Continuous Probability Distribution**: Deals with continuous outcomes (e.g., height, weight).

#### Normal Distribution
- **Definition**: A type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. It is symmetrical and follows a bell-shaped curve.

- **Properties**:
  - Mean, median, and mode are all equal.
  - The total area under the curve is equal to 1.

**Formula**:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\]
where \(\mu\) is the mean and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation.

**Example**:
If a data set of student heights follows a normal distribution with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm, you can calculate the probability of a student being taller than a certain height using the Z-score.

**R Code for Normal Distribution**:
```r
x <- seq(140, 200, by=1)
y <- dnorm(x, mean=170, sd=10)
plot(x, y, type='l', main='Normal Distribution', xlab='Height (cm)', ylab='Density')
```

**Python Code for Normal Distribution**:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats

x = np.linspace(140, 200, 100)
y = stats.norm.pdf(x, 170, 10)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Normal Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Height (cm)')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.show()
```

### 4. Correlation Concept

#### Correlation
- **Definition**: Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.

- **Types**:
  - **Positive Correlation**: As one variable increases, the other also increases.
  - **Negative Correlation**: As one variable increases, the other decreases.
  - **No Correlation**: No relationship between the variables.

- **Correlation Coefficient**: Ranges from -1 to +1.
  - \(+1\): Perfect positive correlation
  - \(0\): No correlation
  - \(-1\): Perfect negative correlation

**Formula**:
\[
\text{Correlation}(x, y) = \frac{\text{Cov}(x, y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
\]

**Example**:
If you have data on hours studied and test scores, you can determine the correlation to see if more study hours relate to higher test scores.

**R Code for Correlation**:
```r
study_hours <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
test_scores <- c(60, 70, 80, 90, 100)


correlation <- cor(study_hours, test_scores)
print(paste("Correlation:", correlation))
```

**Python Code for Correlation**:
```python
import numpy as np

study_hours = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
test_scores = np.array([60, 70, 80, 90, 100])
correlation = np.corrcoef(study_hours, test_scores)[0, 1]

print(f"Correlation: {correlation}")
```

## **Section 4: Machine Learning Concepts**

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Definition**: A simple algorithm that classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It is a non-parametric method.
- **How it works**: 
  - Choose the number of \(k\) neighbors.
  - For a new point, find the \(k\) closest points in the training set.
  - Assign the most common label among those neighbors.

**Example**:
Given training data with different categories, if \(k=3\) and a new point has two neighbors from category A and one from category B, it will be classified as category A.

**Python Code**:
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Sample Data
X_train = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
y_train = ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B']

model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict([[1.5]])
print(f'Predicted Class: {prediction[0]}')
```

### 2. Classification
- **Definition**: A supervised learning technique used to classify data into predefined categories.
- **Example**: Logistic regression can be used to predict whether a customer will buy a product (1) or not (0) based on features.

**Python Code**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Sample Data
X_train = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
y_train = [0, 0, 1, 1]

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict([[1.5]])
print(f'Predicted Class: {prediction[0]}')
```

### 3. Regression
- **Definition**: A method for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Example**: Using linear regression to predict house prices based on size.

**Python Code**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample Data
X_train = [[1], [2], [3]]
y_train = [100, 150, 200]

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict([[1.5]])
print(f'Predicted Price: {prediction[0]}')
```

### 4. Decision Tree
- **Definition**: A flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label.
- **Example**: Classifying whether a fruit is an apple or an orange based on features like weight and color.

**Python Code**:
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Sample Data
X_train = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]
y_train = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Orange']

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict([[1, 0]])
print(f'Predicted Fruit: {prediction[0]}')
```

### 5. Random Forest
- **Definition**: An ensemble method that creates a forest of decision trees, usually trained with the "bagging" method. It improves the accuracy and controls overfitting.
- **Example**: Using a random forest to classify customer churn based on multiple features.

**Python Code**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Sample Data
X_train = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
y_train = ['Churn', 'Stay', 'Churn', 'Stay']

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict([[1.5]])
print(f'Predicted Churn: {prediction[0]}')
```
